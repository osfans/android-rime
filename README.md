## History
TRIME is the abbreviation of *Tongwen RIME* or *ThaeRv Input Method*.

From the beginning, TRIME was written for TaeRv Pinyin, and named *TaeRv Input Method (泰如输入法)*.

Then, we created an input method platform with some code tables, such as Wu dialect (吴语). We renamed it to *Chinese Character Dialect Input Method (汉字方言输入法)*.

Later, it supports Wubi and Liangbi and other shape-based input method, we branded it [*Tongwen Input Method Platform 2.0 (同文输入法平台 2.0)*](https://github.com/osfans/trime-legacy), which implies that the phonetic-based and shape-based input method on one platform, while dialects and Mandrain share one kind of characters.

TRIME now upgrade to 3.0, enjoying the advantages of [librime](https://github.com/rime/librime) with Java Native Interface, referring to as *Tongwen Input Method (同文输入法)*.

```bash
cd $your_folder
git clone --recursive https://github.com/osfans/trime.git trime
```

2. If you would like to test the application, run:

```bash
cd $trime_folder
make debug
```

Or if you want to sign for the app to release, create a `keystore.properties` contains following contents for [signing information](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html):

```bash
storePassword=myStorePassword
keyPassword=mykeyPassword
keyAlias=myKeyAlias
storeFile=myStoreFileLocation
```

then run:

```bash
cd $trime_folder
make release
```

### Guides
#### [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)

  ```bash
   yay -S android-{ndk,sdk,sdk-build-tools,sdk-platform-tools,platform} gradle clang capnproto
   make release
  ```

  For other Linux distributions, please also install the required packages above with their own package managers.

#### macOS

1. It's recommended that install Android [SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html) manually or via Android Studio.
